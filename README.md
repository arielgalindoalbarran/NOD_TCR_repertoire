# The repertoire of newly developing regulatory T cells in the type I diabetes-prone NOD mouse is very diverse.

Regulatory T lymphocytes expressing the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxp3 (Treg) play a vital role in the protection of the organism from autoimmune disease and other immunopathologies. The antigen-specificity of Treg plays an important role in their in vivo activity. We therefore assessed the diversity of the T cell receptors for antigen (TCR) expressed by Treg newly developed in the thymus of autoimmune type I diabetes-prone NOD mice and compared it to the control mouse strain C57BL/6. Our results demonstrate that usage of the TCRα and TCRβ variable (V) and joining (J) segments, length of the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3, and the diversity of the TCRα and TCRβ chains are comparable between NOD and C57BL/6 mice. Genetic defects affecting the diversity of the TCR expressed by newly developed Treg therefore do not appear to be involved in the etiology of type I diabetes in the NOD mouse.
